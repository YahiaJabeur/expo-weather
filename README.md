## Why Expo?

This project uses [Expo](https://expo.dev/) because it is now recommended by React Native contributors as of the latest conference. Expo simplifies the development process by providing a set of tools and services that are well-integrated with React Native, ensuring a smoother and more efficient workflow.

## File-Based Routing with Expo Router

This project uses `expo-router` for navigation, leveraging file-based routing for an intuitive and organized structure. The screen files are named according to `expo-router` conventions, ensuring consistency and clarity in the project.

### Key Features of Expo Router:
- **File-Based Routing**: Each screen corresponds to a file, making navigation straightforward and maintenance easier.
- **Naming Conventions**: Screens are named following `expo-router` conventions. This means that the file names directly reflect the routes, providing a clear and predictable routing system.
